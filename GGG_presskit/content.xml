    <studio>A Game by Both Good</studio>
    <!-- <meta-description></meta-description>-->
 
     <description>Goo Goo Grapplers is 1v1 Couch battle arena where you compete with your twin to see who is truly 
         the better baby. Gather “Toy Parts” in exchange for powerful new abilities and upgrades that you can 
         mix and match however you see fit. Shoot some milk, swing a rattle, and toot your way to victory as you lead an army of imaginary friends to take down your siblings pillow fort in this whacky little world.</description>
 
    <history>From the beginning Goo Goo Grapplers had the goal to bring together elements from two very 
          different places- Platform fighters and MOBAs. In 2023 the first prototype was born, manifesting as 
          something between a tower defense and a fighting game. And while fun, like many prototypes it 
          wasn’t ready to be developed further, and the idea was put to rest. However, after a year more of 
          experience working on various games and gradually getting a small team together, Goo Goo 
          Grapplers awoke from its nap. In it’s new form GGG takes a different approach, bringing together the 
          gameplay, flow and strategy of a MOBA and the accessible, goofy couch fun of a platform fighter. 
          Committed to its development and release, “Both Good” was formed in 2024. The new studio’s aim 
          was not only set on completing and releasing GGG, but also on beginning the early stages of future 
          IPs that are yet to be revealed.</history>
